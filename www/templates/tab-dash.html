    <h2>Welcome to my demo</h2>
    <p>This is the Ionic starter for tabs-based apps. I used it to show an interesting thing I have found in working with `ion-tab`. If you use `ng-if` with `ion-tab`, your app can break in interesting ways.</p>

    <h4>Navigate to 'Account' and then click 'Chat' to see what I mean.</h4>
